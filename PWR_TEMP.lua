		The domoticz object holds all information about your Domoticz system. E.g.:

		local myDevice = domoticz.devices('myDevice')
		local myVariable = domoticz.variables('myUserVariable')
		local myGroup = domoticz.groups('myGroup')
		local myScene = domoticz.sceneds('myScene')

		The device object is the device that was triggered due to the device in the 'on' section above.
